<h1>GREEN ENERGY DRIVEN TRANPORTATION AND WIRELESS EV CHARGING ROADS</h1>
<P>The increasing global demand for sustainable transportation solutions has led to significant innovations in the electric vehicle (EV) industry and innovative charging infrastructure.
  In this report, we propose the emerging concept of integrating renewable energy sources with wireless charging road systems, presenting a compelling synergy to address the challenges hindering widespread EV adoption.
  The current state of the electric vehicle market leads in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels Solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems are incorporated to power the charging infrastructure, reducing its reliance on non-renewable energy sources and enhancing sustainability. Next, we present the concept of wireless charging roads, which have the potential to revolutionize EV charging. These systems leverage inductive charging technology embedded within road surfaces to replenish EV batteries while in motion, effectively. By harnessing clean energy sources, overcoming range limitations, 
  and enhancing the overall EV experience, this technology represents a pioneering step towards a greener, more efficient, and sustainable future for mobility.</P>
